## About me
<small>I am currently doing **PhD in Computer Science** at the [SFI Centre for Research Training in Digitally-Enhanced Reality (CRT-DReal)](https://d-real.ie/) at [Technological University Dublin](https://www.tudublin.ie/). My Ph.D. research focuses on the Monitoring and Short-term Forecasting of Atmospheric Air Pollutants Using Deep Neural Networks. The world is undergoing rapid urbanization and industrialization, leading to a significant deterioration in air quality. According to World Health Organization data, air quality in most cities does not meet safe guidelines. Exposure to air pollutants poses serious long-term health risks, including heart disease, nerve damage, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Even limited exposure to air pollutants can have a detrimental impact on health. As part of my research, I am developing an AI-based prediction system employing deep learning, computer vision, and satellite imagery to provide rapid, precise, and dependable warnings.</small>

## Exprience 

<small>1. **Tutor/Senior Demonstrator** in [Technological University Dublin, Ireland](https://www.tudublin.ie/) from 2023/01–2023/06. I served as a Tutor and Senior Demonstrator in the School of Informatics and Cybersecurity, where I specialized in Secure Programming.</small>

<small> 2. **Junior Research Fellow** in [National Institute of Technology Jamshedpur, India](https://www.nitjsr.ac.in/) from 2020/12–2022/08. My work involved monitoring and predicting time-series data using deep learning models and computer vision, forecasting air quality pollutants, and analyzing satellite data for predictive insights.</small>

<small>2. **Project Assistant (Level-III)** in [CSIR-Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CSIR-CIMFR)](https://cimfr.nic.in/), India from 2018/12–2020/10. My responsibilities included developing vision enhancement software for foggy weather using TensorFlow and OpenCV. Also, creating Digital Mine software with Django, Python, and IoT technologies, predicting mine hazards with deep learning models, and developing a voice communication system using Raspberry Pi, MAT-LAB, and Simulink.</small>

<small>**Assistant Professor** in [Ramgovind Institute of Technology, India](https://rgc.edu.in/) form 2017/02–2018/07. I taught courses on computer networks, operating systems, database manage- ment, algorithms, and data structures.</small>

## Education

- **BTech in Computer Science and Engineering** - Kolkata (India):  
  I did my graduation with a comprehensive background in computer science and post-graduation in information technology from the [West Bengal University of Technology](https://makautwb.ac.in/), India. I developed a computational attitude towards all physical phenomena during my university and presented them in a mathematical model. During my graduation, I solve real-life problems using computational intelligence.

- **MTech in Information Technology** - Kolkata (India):  
  I did my post-graduation in information technology from the [MAULANA ABUL KALAM AZAD UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, WEST BENGAL](https://makautwb.ac.in/). My MTech thesis was **“Developed Energy-Efficient Smart City Design using Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)”**. The primary aim of the project was to develop an algorithm for constructing an energy-efficient smart city. Here, the WLAN controller was designed so that if no node sends a request to the Access Point (AP), the AP will be switched from its active to sleep mode.
  
- **PhD in School of Computer Science** - Dublin (Ireland):  
Currently I doing **PhD in Computer Science** at the [SFI Centre for Research Training in Digitally-Enhanced Reality (CRT-DReal)](https://d-real.ie/) at [Technological University Dublin](https://www.tudublin.ie/). My PhD is focused on Monitoring and Short-term Forecasting of Atmospheric Air Pollutants Using Deep Neural Networks.
