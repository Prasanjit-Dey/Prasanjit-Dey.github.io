# About me
I am currently doing **PhD in Computer Science** at the [SFI Centre for Research Training in Digitally-Enhanced Reality (CRT-DReal)](https://d-real.ie/) at [Technological University Dublin](https://www.tudublin.ie/).

*My PhD is focused on Monitoring and Short-term Forecasting of Atmospheric Air Pollutants Using Deep Neural Networks. The world is being urbanised and industrialised at an increasingly accelerated rate and as a result, air quality has significantly deteriorated. World Health Organisation data indicates that air quality in most cities fails to meet safe guidelines. Air pollutants such as SO2 and others have serious long-term exposure effects including heart disease, nerve damage, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Even limited exposure to air pollutants is a significant detriment to health, therefore there is a clear need to monitor and provide accurate short-term (1-4 hr) forecasting of atmospheric air pollutants for early warning purposes. Therefore, to prevent citizens being exposed to dangerous air quality conditions, accurate early warning systems are critical to provide citizens with warnings and health recommendations. My main objective will develop an effective atmospheric pollutant monitoring tools in a fast, accurate, and reliable fashion, as discussed via the following sections.*

## Previous work experiences

- **Project Associate (Level-II)** - India:  
  I worked as a Project Associate (Level-II) in Mine Mechanization, Automation and Technology Development (MMATD) of [CSIR-Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CSIR-CIMFR)](https://cimfr.nic.in/), Dhanbad under the aegis Of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India. I worked on project titles *“Development of vision enhancement system for foggy weather”* and *“Development of digital mine using internet of things”*.

- **Assistant Professor** - India:  
  I have an excellent knowledge of Teaching. I worked as an Assistant Professor at [Ramgovind Institute of Technology](https://rgc.edu.in/) at Jharkhand, India. I taught the subjects such as Computer Network, Artificial Intelligence, Algorithm, Data Structure, and Database Management.

## Education

- **BTech in Computer Science and Engineering** - Kolkata (India):  
  I did my graduation with a comprehensive background in computer science and post-graduation in information technology from the [West Bengal University of Technology](https://makautwb.ac.in/), India. I developed a computational attitude towards all physical phenomena during my university and presented them in a mathematical model. During my graduation, I solve real-life problems using computational intelligence.

- **MTech in Information Technology** - Kolkata (India):  
  I did my post-graduation in information technology from the [MAULANA ABUL KALAM AZAD UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, WEST BENGAL](https://makautwb.ac.in/). My MTech thesis was **“Developed Energy-Efficient Smart City Design using Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)”**. The primary aim of the project was to develop an algorithm for constructing an energy-efficient smart city. Here, the WLAN controller was designed so that if no node sends a request to the Access Point (AP), the AP will be switched from its active to sleep mode.
  
- **PhD in School of Computer Science** - Dublin (Ireland):  
Currently I doing **PhD in Computer Science** at the [SFI Centre for Research Training in Digitally-Enhanced Reality (CRT-DReal)](https://d-real.ie/) at [Technological University Dublin](https://www.tudublin.ie/). My PhD is focused on Monitoring and Short-term Forecasting of Atmospheric Air Pollutants Using Deep Neural Networks.
