# About me
I am currently doing **PhD in Computer Science** at the [SFI Centre for Research Training in Digitally-Enhanced Reality (CRT-DReal)](https://d-real.ie/) at [Technological University Dublin](https://www.tudublin.ie/).

*My PhD is focused on Monitoring and Short-term Forecasting of Atmospheric Air Pollutants Using Deep Neural Networks. The world is being urbanised and industrialised at an increasingly accelerated rate and as a result, air quality has significantly deteriorated. World Health Organisation data indicates that air quality in most cities fails to meet safe guidelines. Air pollutants such as SO2 and others have serious long-term exposure effects including heart disease, nerve damage, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Even limited exposure to air pollutants is a significant detriment to health, therefore there is a clear need to monitor and provide accurate short-term (1-4 hr) forecasting of atmospheric air pollutants for early warning purposes. Therefore, to prevent citizens being exposed to dangerous air quality conditions, accurate early warning systems are critical to provide citizens with warnings and health recommendations. My main objective will develop an effective atmospheric pollutant monitoring tools in a fast, accurate, and reliable fashion, as discussed via the following sections.*

## Previous work experiences

- **Machine Learning R&D Engineer** - Shanghai:  
  I completed my end-of-study internship in Shanghai as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer for a sino-french startup called **[Mediasia-Labs](http://mediasia-labs.com)**. I have been working on *Deep-Learning* and *Advanced Algorithms* applied to Pronunciation Evaluation for language learners.

- **Research Assistant** - Daejon (South-Korea):  
  I have been a volunteer in a Research Laboratory dedicated to Artificial Intelligence **[AIM](http://slsp.kaist.ac.kr/xe/)** where I worked on video classification for the CVPR2017 workshop, especially working on *Attention Gated LSTM Cell*, in TensorFlow.

- **Software Engineer Intern** - Paris:  
  I have been an intern at **[Aerow](https://www.aerow.group/en/home/)** in Paris, as a Software Engineer and integrator. I have been developing a simple OCR for bankcheques CMC7 code, using simple *Machine-Learning* techniques.

## Education

- **Graduate Exchange Program** - Daejeon (South-Korea):  
  I studied abroad for a year in the top university of KAIST in South-Korea, where I specialized in *Machine-Learning*. I completed my initial background with skills in *Deep-Learning*, NLP, Computer Vision as well as Search-Based Algorithms.

- **Master Of Engineering** - Rouen (France):  
  I graduated from INSA Rouen Normandy with a Master of Engineering in April 2018, majoring in *Applied Mathematics* and *Computer Science*.
