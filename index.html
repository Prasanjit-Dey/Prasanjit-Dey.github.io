I am currently doing PhD in Computer Science at the SFI Centre for Research Training in Digitally-Enhanced Reality (CRT-DReal) at Technological University.
<br />
My PhD is focused on Monitoring and Short-term Forecasting of Atmospheric Air Pollutants Using Deep Neural Networks. The world is being urbanised and industrialised at an increasingly accelerated rate and as a result, air quality has significantly deteriorated. World Health Organisation data indicates that air quality in most cities fails to meet safe guidelines. Air pollutants such as SO2 and others have serious long-term exposure effects including heart disease, nerve damage, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Even limited exposure to air pollutants is a significant detriment to health, therefore there is a clear need to monitor and provide accurate short-term (1-4 hr) forecasting of atmospheric air pollutants for early warning purposes. Therefore, to prevent citizens being exposed to dangerous air quality conditions, accurate early warning systems are critical to provide citizens with warnings and health recommendations. My main objective will develop an effective atmospheric pollutant monitoring tools in a fast, accurate, and reliable fashion, as discussed via the following sections.
