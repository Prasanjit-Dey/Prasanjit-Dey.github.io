## Computer Vision

- <small>**Vision Enhancement for Foggy Weather using Computer Vision** (CSIR-CIMFR project): The project encompassed real-time image stitching using the OpenCV library, real-time vision enhancement algorithms, and real-time object detection using YOLO models.</small>

## Time series
- **Short-term Forecasting of Atmospheric Air Pollutants using Deep Neural Networks** (PhD project): This project aims to forecast atmospheric air pollutants, monitor and identify pollu- tants using satellite data and image processing, and develop an early warning system for hazardous gases in open air.
   
- <small>**Time-series data prediction using Deep Learning** (NIT-Jamshedpur project): This project included the prediction of time-series data with satellite data and com- puter vision methodologies.</small>

## IoT

- <small>**Digital Mine Using Internet of Things (IoT)** (CSIR-CIMFR project): This project included modules for mine gas monitoring and prediction using deep learning, IoT-based miners tracking, strata monitoring and prediction, and machine health monitoring and prediction using deep learning.</small>
